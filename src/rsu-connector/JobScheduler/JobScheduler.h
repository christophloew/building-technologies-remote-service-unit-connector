/// @brief This class provides a way to schedule tasks in regular intervals.
/// The tick interval can be specified by the user via the constructor.
/// The user is then expected to call the Tick() method once each interval, this class does not start any thread itself.
/// The class also does not call *::now() on a system provided timer to increase testability. If the user cares
/// that the runtime of the jobs will extend the tick interval, this has to be corrected for externally (by reducing the
/// time between ticks).
/// The added jobs will be called when their interval has been reached or exceeded. After a call, their interval counter is reset to zero,
/// so if a job has an interval of 150ms set and the tick interval is 100ms, the job will only be called every 200ms.
/// The user should not depend on the order of task execution.
/// If a tasks throws an exception, it is caught and a log message is generated.
